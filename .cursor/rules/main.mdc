# 🔹 General Coding Rules
- Write code in a clear, minimal, and maintainable style — readability over clever one-liners.
- Keep UI intact when optimizing performance; only suggest UX changes if explicitly requested.
- Maintain consistent naming conventions:
  - camelCase for JS
  - snake_case for Python
  - PascalCase for components
- When debugging errors, explain step by step (cause + solution).
- Add concise docstrings for functions and classes; avoid boilerplate.

# 🔹 Web & App Development Rules
- Prioritize performance (smooth 60–120 FPS, fast load times, efficient rendering).
- Respect existing folder/component structure — don’t reorganize unless asked.
- Only suggest new libraries if:
  1. The feature cannot be done cleanly with the current stack.
  2. The library is lightweight and widely supported.
- Keep React/React Native components minimalistic and styled consistently (Tailwind / iOS “liquid-glass” look).
- When converting web apps to mobile, ensure functionality parity first, polish UI second.



# 🔹 Workflow Rules
- Show diffs instead of replacing entire files when suggesting edits.

# 🔹 Personal Style Rules
- Default mindset: optimize performance without breaking aesthetics.
